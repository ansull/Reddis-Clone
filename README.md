# Redis Clone

A custom, lightweight implementation of Redis, the popular in-memory key-value store. This project replicates essential Redis features, offering a fast and simple way to store and retrieve data in memory.

## What is this?

- **In-memory storage**: Quick data access with key-value pairs.
- **Supported types**: Strings, lists, sets, and hash maps.
- **Basic commands**: Implements a set of core Redis-like commands (e.g., `SET`, `GET`, `DEL`).
- **Persistence**: Optional feature to save data to disk.
- **Simple design**: Built for learning, experimenting, and contributing.
